       "'<think>\\nAlright, so I need to expand the term \"rag\" for better search results. Let me think about all possible meanings and related terms that might be associated with \"rag.\" \\n\\nFirst off, \"rag\" can refer to animal hair. That\\'s straightforward, but maybe adding something about its texture could help. Words like curly, fine, silky come to mind because they describe the appearance of animal hair.\\n\\nI also remember that in art or painting, \"rag\" might be used metaphorically to describe a rough, unpolished surface. So expanding on that with terms like weathered, worn away sounds useful.\\n\\nIn gaming contexts, particularly card games, \"rag\" can mean a specific card. That\\'s another relevant term, so including it makes sense. It\\'s probably used when discussing playing cards or strategy games.\\n\\nI should also consider the physical aspects—like how tightly wound or thick it is could be important terms for someone searching for information on ragging. So adding terms like tight wound and thick might add more depth to the query.\\n\\nMoreover, in historical contexts, especially in music or literature, \"rag\" can refer to a long, flowing melody. Including that term would give the search wider scope if it\\'s used there.\\n\\nThinking about materials, since hair is often made of various substances, expanding on that with things like silk, cotton, wool, and linen could be helpful for specific searches related to animal fur or natural fibers.\\n\\nIn culinary contexts, especially in certain cuisines, \"rag\" might refer to a particular sauce. That\\'s another useful term if it\\'s being used in that context.\\n\\nLastly, when discussing clothing, particularly tight-fitting attire, \"rag\" can denote the style of clothing with such characteristics. This could be relevant for someone looking into fashion or specific types of wear.\\n\\nPutting all these together, I think expanding \" rag\" with terms like animal hair, texture, weathered, worn away, card, playing cards, long flowing melody, material, and clothing attire would cover a broad range of contexts where the term might appear. It should help in providing more precise search results across various topics related to hair or related substances.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe expanded list of terms related to \"rag\" includes:\\n\\n- Animal hair\\n- Texture (curly, fine, silky)\\n- Weathered, worn away\\n- Card\\n- Playing cards\\n- Long flowing melody\\n- Material (silk, cotton, wool, linen)\\n- Dressage\\n- Running shoe'"
